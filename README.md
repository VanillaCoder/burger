# burger
<p>This app allows a user to enter in a burger they would like to eat. The burger then displays under a left-hand column labeled "Uneaten" with a button allowing them to eat it. If they click the button the burger will appear on the right hand side of the screen under a colum labeled "Eaten." All of the data and logic is stored and handled server side. Technologies used: Handlebars, Express, MySQL, HTML, Bootstrap, and sequelize.</p>
